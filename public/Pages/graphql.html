            <h2>What is GraphQL?</h2>
            <p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data.
                It allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving performance and reducing over-fetching.</p>

            <h2>Setting Up HotChocolate</h2>
            <p>HotChocolate is a .NET GraphQL server implementation that supports both schema-first and code-first
                approaches. To set up HotChocolate in your project, follow these steps:</p>
            <pre><code>
1. Install the HotChocolate NuGet package:
   dotnet add package HotChocolate.AspNetCore

2. Create a GraphQL schema class:
   public class Query
   {
       public string Hello() => "Hello, World!";
   }

3. Configure GraphQL in Startup.cs:
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddGraphQL(sp => SchemaBuilder.New().AddQueryType<Query>());
   }

4. Add the GraphQL endpoint in Configure method:
   app.UseRouting();
   app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
   {
       endpoints.MapGraphQL();
   });
            </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Schema-First vs Code-First</h2>
            <p>With HotChocolate, you can choose between schema-first and code-first approaches:</p>
            <div class="Key-feature-cards">
                <div class="key-feature-card">
                    <p><strong>Schema-First:</strong> You define the schema using GraphQL SDL (Schema Definition Language) and implement resolvers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="key-feature-card">
                    <p><strong>Code-First:</strong> You define your schema using C# code and rely on reflection to create the schema.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Example Query</h2>
            <p>Once your GraphQL API is set up, you can query data like this:</p>
            <pre><code>
query {
   hello
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>This would return:</p>
            <pre><code>
{
  "data": {
    "hello": "Hello, World!"
  }
}
            </code></pre>

                <div >
                    1. Set up a basic GraphQL server with HotChocolate in a .NET environment.
                    <br>2. Create a data model using Entity Framework Core.
                    <br>3. Define queries and mutations for your GraphQL API to interact with the database.
                    <br>4. Integrate SQL with GraphQL for efficient data fetching and manipulation.
                    <br>5. The tutorial is important as it demonstrates a full-fledged, real-world scenario where you combine GraphQL and SQL databases to create a seamless API for managing complex systems like a restaurant's order processing.
