                    <h3>What is a transaction in SQL Server?</h3>
                    <p id="answer1" class="answer">A transaction is a unit of work that is performed on the database. It ensures that all operations within it are completed successfully, and if any operation fails, the transaction is rolled back.</p>

                    <h3>What are the ACID properties of a transaction?</h3>
                    <p id="answer2" class="answer">The ACID properties ensure that transactions are processed reliably:
                        <div>Atomicity: All operations in a transaction are treated as a single unit.</div>
                        <div>Consistency: The database must transition from one valid state to another.</div>
                        <div>Isolation: Transactions do not interfere with each other.</div>
                        <div>Durability: Once a transaction is committed, it is permanent.</div>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <h3>What is the COMMIT command?</h3>
                    <p id="answer3" class="answer">The COMMIT command is used to save the changes made during the transaction to the database.</p>
                    <pre><code>COMMIT;</code></pre>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>What is the ROLLBACK command?</h3>
                    <p id="answer4" class="answer">The ROLLBACK command is used to undo changes made during a transaction.</p>
                    <pre><code>ROLLBACK;</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>What are the isolation levels in SQL Server?</h3>
                    <p id="answer5" class="answer">SQL Server provides several isolation levels to control how transactions are handled:
                        <div>READ UNCOMMITTED</div>
                        <div>READ COMMITTED</div>
                        <div>REPEATABLE READ</div>
                        <div>SERIALIZABLE</div>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <h3>How do you begin a transaction in SQL Server?</h3>
                    <p id="answer6" class="answer">You can begin a transaction using the <code>BEGIN TRANSACTION</code> </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-card" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer7')">

                <div>
                    <h3>What is a savepoint in SQL Server?</h3>
                    <p id="answer7" class="answer">A savepoint allows you to set a point within a transaction to which you can roll back, without affecting the entire transaction.</p>
                    <pre><code>SAVE TRANSACTION savepoint_name;</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>What is the purpose of the SET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS option?</h3>
                    <p id="answer8" class="answer">The SET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS option is used to automatically begin a new transaction after each SQL statement is executed.</p>
                    <pre><code>SET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS ON;</code></pre>
                </div>
